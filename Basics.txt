<OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING NOTES>

So to represent the real life object.
so we will represent tem in program , like book animal human student and 
other objecrts.
A class is user defined data type
A class is the basic building block of OOP.
Primitive Datatype ;- int float bool predefine data tyoe 
class is complex Datatype. If you want to save whole user info then 
you have to store all charcterstic 
All veriable has different data tyoe ,so we can compile 
them in a single programm 
You should stored informtion according to you code.
In C++ we have three acess modifiers 
=================================================================
1.Private  what ever is private that willl not be accesssed outside of the class
2.Public You will access outside of the class
3.Protected : It is more in between concepts and it has rules related to it ..Later we will discuss with inheritensc
Everything by default is private 
<Class Methods>
So ho we can discribe behaviour of classs
we have to create a function in class we have created

<CONSTRUCTOOS>
whenever we create ,it is a special type of method 
which is invokedwhenevver an object is created.
Constructors are formed 
Default constructor is automatically generated by compiler
<Rules>
constructor is special method 
it has no any return type 
name should be as the class it belongs to 
Constructor must be Public ,mostly


<Encapsulation>
A process in which we make some of the data member prvate and onlly by certain
methods we can access them within the class. WE encapsulate data and dont 
allow any random peron to make changes to that data. By using 
setters and Getters we can make access them

<Abstraction INOOOOP>
It is hidding the complex things behind procedure to make them simple
Smart phone abstractions ;we have to press a button and take a picture but reality 
is different but the company has a difficult logic to impliment,.
THere is a an interface betweeen you and the dark Logic xD. On your side everything is simple
and all complexity is on side of the company. You dont need to know the hidden 
complexity behind your phone in order to use the simple features. 
You can use with ease what ever you wanna do.
So companies hide these complex things and provide you a livishing 
interface if you would see complexity most probably you won't understand or 
You will not like the ugly complexities.
HIdding complexity is known as Abstraction. How we can impliment this
